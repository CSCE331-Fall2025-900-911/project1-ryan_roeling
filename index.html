      What I may lack in professional experience, I make up for in dedication to learning, persistence, and a creative drive to solve problems. I approach challenges in computer science by defining them clearly, breaking them down, and iterating until I discover a viable solution. My optimistic outlook and relentless pursuit of improvement are qualities I carry into every project I work on.

      My journey into computer science began in high school, where a game design course first sparked my passion for programming. Since then, I've had immense joy pursuing CS as a professional path, from building 2D and 3D games in Unity (<a href="https://unity.com/" target="_blank">Unity</a>) to tackling algorithms, data structures, and even seam-carving programs in my university courses. Each project has deepened my skills and reinforced my excitement for the field.

      Today, I'm especially fascinated by artificial intelligence and its potential to reshape the way we live and work. I aim to continue developing as both a problem-solver and collaborator, and I look forward to contributing to projects where AI and innovative software can make a real impact.
