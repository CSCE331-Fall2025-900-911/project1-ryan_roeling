        <h2>Simulated Multithreading in Java</h2>
        <p>During this project, I learned how to implement locks and run simultaneous functions throughout a program. Concurrency is vital for efficiency in higher-functioning systems, and this gave me insight into performance optimization.</p>

        <h2>Binary Search Tree Algorithm</h2>
        <p>Implementing a binary search tree introduced me to searching and sorting algorithms. I learned to use comparators and in-order traversal, which served as a foundation for understanding more complex data structures.</p>

        <h2>Unity Game Development</h2>
        <p>I started coding by building 2D and 3D games in Unity. While simple in retrospect, these games taught me how to program in C# and inspired me to pursue computer science as a career path.</p>

        <h2>Website Development</h2>
        <p>This site itself is one of my most rewarding projects, built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It gave me practical experience combining front-end languages into a cohesive project.</p>

        <h2>Simulated CPU</h2>
        <p>Using hardware description languages, I designed a simulated CPU inside a computer system. This was one of my most difficult but rewarding projects, requiring precise logic and persistence.</p>
