        To describe myself in a professional capacity, I would say that what I lack in experience in the field, I make up for in dedication to learning and work ethic. When I am approaching an issue in computer science, I work at the problem by defining the issue at face value, and then iterate through the problem without hesitation until a viable solution could be broached. I think my creative drive and optimistic outlook will set me apart from my contemporaries, and I hope that my relentless pursuit to improve myself can propel me above the competition.
      </p>

      <p>
        In regards to projects, I have been versing myself in coding for the last six years, and I have many projects under my belt (some I am more proud of than others). I have previously worked on developing both two dimensional and three dimensional games through the unity game engine when I was in high school. Since then, I have developed my skills at university through projects like developing a binary search tree to deepen my comprehension with searching algorithms as well as developing seam carving programs to manually shave and crop image resolutions in both the vertical and horizontal plane. Furthermore, I would include that I have developed skills outside of coding as well; my courses and life experiences have given me many opportunities to collaborate with students from various backgrounds while contributing in both leading and supporting roles on a team.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout my history of coding, the many trials and tribulations have offered me decent knowledge with languages such as Java, C++, C#, Haskell, html, css, and JavaScript. To this extent, I would say I am rather privy to working on the back-end portion of the coding development process; I find navigating heirarchies and data structures to a more coherent process than measuring precise user interface functions on the front-end.
      </p>

      <p>
        My areas of interest in the field lie mostly in the fields of AI development and game design; although, game design I find as more as a hobby than a professional pursuit. I find the field of AI particularly interesting because it seems that the trend of artificial intelligence implementation has morphed into somewhat of a buzzword for businesses to sound appealing rather than truly harnessing the power of developing AI integration--properly--into their work. I stay up to date on these fields by routinely mulling over news involving AI in business or other articles relating to generative AI's new developments or applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the next couple of years, I hope to have gone to grad school to pursue a master's degree in either computer science or business, and I hope to apply my diploma, and accompanying education, to work in various roles at a company or start up. I hope to join these companies in search for new opportunities to learn different aspects of the field of computer science, and--by the end--deepen my understanding and connection with artificial intelligence's role in the future of the field. This could vary from many positions such as an AI consultant, software engineer, or any managerial position at a company with a background in tech.
