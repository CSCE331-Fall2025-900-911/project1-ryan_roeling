      <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
      <p>
        I am a computer science student with a strong foundation in software engineering principles, systems thinking, and collaborative development practices. My academic background and project work have given me hands-on experience in object-oriented programming, concurrency, algorithm design, and modern web development. I enjoy problem-solving, learning new frameworks, and applying abstract concepts to practical problems.
      </p>

      <h2>Experience & Strengths</h2>
      <p>
        I have worked on projects ranging from small utility scripts to full Java applications. Through these, I have learned how to design software with scalability in mind, as well as how to debug complex issues such as race conditions in multithreaded programs. My strengths include clear communication, structured problem-solving, and a passion for continuous improvement. I also value clean, readable code and consistently apply naming conventions and documentation practices.
      </p>

      <h2>Technical Interests</h2>
      <p>
        My primary interests lie in systems programming and software design. I enjoy exploring concurrency, operating systems, and distributed systems, as well as the intersection between back-end infrastructure and user-facing applications. I am also fascinated by human-centered design and the challenges of creating intuitive tools that make complex technology accessible. I would like to contribute to open-source projects that emphasize developer tools, visualization of algorithms, or community education resources.
      </p>

      <h2>Future Goals</h2>
      <p>
        Looking ahead, I aim to deepen my knowledge of cloud infrastructure, containerization, and scalable microservices. I am also motivated to participate in hackathons and collaborative team projects that simulate real-world engineering challenges. By developing both technical expertise and teamwork skills, I hope to prepare myself for a career where I can contribute to innovative and reliable software solutions.
